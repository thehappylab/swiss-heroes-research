## Behavioral Instructions (Updated)

### Task Pickup Signal
- When picking up a message/task, add 👀 reaction to acknowledge
- This signals "I'm on it" to the user

### Date-Sensitive Operations Rule ⭐ NEW
- **ALWAYS** run `date` or `session_status` before any date-sensitive operation
- **NEVER** trust file timestamps or memory filenames as "now"
- **VERIFY** current date explicitly before calendar/email scheduling
- This prevents errors like creating events for yesterday

## Session Log

### Calendar Event Error (Lesson Learned)
- User asked for calendar event "today at 1:30pm CET"
- I incorrectly used Feb 17 (from memory filename) instead of actual today (Feb 18)
- Root cause: assumed memory file date = current date
- Fix: Always verify system date before date-sensitive operations
