Findings by Dimension

Price Sensitivity Variations

| Segment                                       | Price Elasticity | Optimal Price Point   |
| --------------------------------------------- | ---------------- | --------------------- |
| High Sensitivity (Small startup, first LMS)   | Very High        | CHF 5-8/user/month    |
| Medium Sensitivity (Mid-size, cost-conscious) | Medium           | CHF 10-15/user/month  |
| Low Sensitivity (Enterprise, experienced)     | Low              | CHF 15-20/user/month  |
| Individual/Prosumer                           | Very High        | CHF 20-30/month total |

Quote (High sensitivity): "CHF 15 per month? That's almost my gym membership. For a website that feels like my university portal from 2015?"

Quote (Low sensitivity): "My CFO doesn't blink at CHF 50,000/year for compliance training. He blinks at audit findings."

Organization Size Variations

| Size              | Decision Speed | Sales Model            | Migration Risk    |
| ----------------- | -------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------- |
| 10-50 employees   | Days/weeks     | Self-serve PLG         | None (greenfield) |
| 50-200 employees  | Weeks/months   | Inside sales + demo    | Low               |
| 200-500 employees | Months         | Field sales + pilot    | Medium            |
| 500+ employees    | 6-12 months    | Enterprise sales + RFP | High              |

Key insight: Small companies (10-50) are the perfect wedge - founder decides, no migration burden, no compliance complexity (yet).

Experience Level Variations

| Experience                      | Evaluation Criteria          | Main Friction          | Sales Strategy            |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Novice (First LMS)              | Trust, simplicity, price     | Fear of wrong choice   | Education, free trial     |
| Intermediate (1-2 platforms)    | Features, UX, ROI            | Migration concerns     | Demo, pilot, case studies |
| Expert (3+ platforms, 8+ years) | Integration, compliance, TCO | Stakeholder management | Consultative sales        |

Persona-Specific Findings

Dissatisfied Power User

• Small/High price (1B): Perfect PLG target - founder decides instantly
• Large/Low price (1C): Needs enterprise sales, evaluates TCO not unit price

Corporate Buyer
• Base (Sandra): Risk-averse, 4-6 month cycle, needs migration service
• Mid-size/First-time (2B): Education-based sales opportunity
• Enterprise/Experienced (2C): 12-18 month cycle, avoid until ready

Non-User / Alternative Seeker

• Base: Rejects LMS premise entirely - wants different product category
• Freelancer (3B): B2C opportunity, CHF 20-30/mo ceiling
• Startup (3C): Values flexibility over consolidation

Quote: "Formal learning platforms feel like eating vegetables. I learn by doing and watching people who are good."
