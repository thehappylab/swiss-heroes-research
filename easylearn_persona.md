Persona 1: The Dissatisfied Power User (Current easylearn User)

Who they are
	•	25–40 years old
	•	Currently using easylearn (or similar Swiss learning platform)
	•	Actively learning for career advancement
	•	Has paid for courses personally
	•	Digitally comfortable

Why this persona is critical

If this person:
	•	Feels friction
	•	Has unmet needs
	•	Has considered alternatives
	•	Would switch under certain conditions

→ You have a wedge.

If they are highly satisfied and see no gaps → competing head-on will be very hard.

What you want to learn
	•	Why they chose easylearn
	•	What almost stopped them from buying
	•	What frustrates them
	•	What they wish existed
	•	What would make them switch
	•	How price-sensitive they are
	•	How they evaluate quality

Strategic Signal
	•	If dissatisfaction is strong → differentiation opportunity
	•	If satisfaction is high and switching costs are high → market may be saturated or locked

Persona 2: The Corporate Buyer / HR Decision-Maker

Who they are
	•	HR manager, L&D lead, or department head
	•	Works in Swiss SME (50–500 employees)
	•	Has purchased training platforms before
	•	Controls or influences learning budgets

Why this persona is critical

In Switzerland, B2B contracts often matter more than individual subscriptions.

If companies:
	•	Default to easylearn because of compliance, certifications, language, or trust
	•	Prefer Swiss-based providers
	•	Have procurement constraints

→ That determines feasibility.

What you want to learn
	•	How they select learning platforms
	•	What criteria matter most (price? accreditation? data security? reporting?)
	•	Why they chose their current provider
	•	What frustrates them
	•	What would make them switch vendors
	•	Budget ranges
	•	Contract length & switching barriers

Strategic Signal
	•	If buying is based on trust & accreditation → barrier to entry is high
	•	If buying is based on price & UX → room for disruption
	•	If SMEs are underserved → niche entry possible

Persona 3: The Non-User / Alternative Seeker

Who they are
	•	20–45 years old
	•	Interested in self-development or professional growth
	•	Has NOT used easylearn
	•	Uses alternatives (YouTube, Coursera, in-person workshops, coaching, etc.)
	•	Could be in creative, startup, or modern sectors

Why this persona is critical

They tell you whether:
	•	The market is larger than easylearn’s current users
	•	There’s a demand for a different positioning
	•	thehappylab could enter from a different angle (community-based, modern, experiential, etc.)

This persona helps you avoid building a slightly better clone.

What you want to learn
	•	Why they didn’t choose easylearn
	•	Whether they considered it
	•	What they dislike about formal platforms
	•	How they discover learning resources
	•	What motivates them to invest in personal growth
	•	Emotional triggers (confidence, career, belonging, etc.)

Strategic Signal
	•	If they reject easylearn’s format → positioning opportunity
	•	If they don’t even know it exists → awareness gap
	•	If they avoid paid learning → monetization challenge
