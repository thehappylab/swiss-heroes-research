## Workspace conventions established

- **Code directory convention:** All project source code must live under `/data/openclaw-data/workspace-builder/code/<project-name>/`. Added to TOOLS.md.
- **Moved cra-check** from `/data/openclaw-data/workspace-builder/cra-check` to `/data/openclaw-data/workspace-builder/code/cra-check` to match convention.
- **Sub-agent timeouts:** Added explicit timeout guidelines to TOOLS.md (light: default, medium: 600s, heavy: 1200s). Default was too short for build/deploy tasks.
- **Sub-agent verbosity:** Added instruction to always tell sub-agents to work silently and only report a final summary. Previous sub-agent runs were dumping stream-of-consciousness into Discord channels.
