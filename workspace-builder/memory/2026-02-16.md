## thehappylab.com — Migrated to Next.js and deployed

**Request from Marcel:** Migrate `thehappylab/thehappylab` repo (static HTML mock) to `thehappylab/app-template` structure.

### What was done:
1. **PR #2** created and merged — migrated static HTML/CSS/JS to full Next.js App Router
   - Landing page with hero, about, projects, contact sections
   - Team profile pages at `/team/marcel`, `/team/isabel`, `/team/dario`
   - Warm orange design system ported to Tailwind CSS custom properties
   - Contact form (placeholder submit), cookie consent banner
   - All template infra preserved: Better Auth, SQLite/Drizzle, Docker, shadcn/ui

2. **Coolify deployment** set up:
   - Project UUID: `y8go80088c404wgcswsckwww` ("The Happy Lab")
   - App UUID: `lgcokwsc4cgokkccsokwkw4k` ("The Happy Lab Website")
   - Server: `coolify-apps` (`v0oo8skgw0ks8080kk00wgkw`)
   - GitHub App: `the-happy-lab-github` (`xgwsc8kgwg08sosswsw408kk`)
   - Domain: `thehappylab.com` (took over from old static deployment)
   - Build pack: Docker Compose
   - Deployed and running ✅

3. **Umami analytics** — already registered:
   - Website ID: `d18a3ea9-4708-467e-b6a7-999ee193c5b3`
   - Domain: `thehappylab.com`
   - Tracking preserved in layout.tsx

### Live verification:
- `https://thehappylab.com` → 200 (Next.js)
- `https://thehappylab.com/team/marcel` → 200
- `https://thehappylab.com/api/health` → 200
