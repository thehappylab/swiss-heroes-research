## Executive Summary

smallinvoice is a Swiss invoice software solution "perfectly tailored to the needs of SMEs." With a focus on simplicity and Swiss-specific features (QR-bills), they've carved out a niche in the crowded invoicing market. However, their feature set is relatively basic and ripe for AI-powered enhancement.

**Disruption Potential: HIGH** - Invoicing is saturated but AI features can differentiate.
