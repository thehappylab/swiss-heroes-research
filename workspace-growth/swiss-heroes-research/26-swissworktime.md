## Executive Summary

SwissWorkTime is a time tracking and attendance application for Swiss companies. With QR code/NFC card stamping, mobile apps, and project tracking, they're a mid-market player. Their focus on physical hardware (NFC cards) creates an opening for purely software-based competitors.

**Disruption Potential: MEDIUM-HIGH** - Hardware-dependent model ripe for pure software play.
