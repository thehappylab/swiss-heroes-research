## Project: Project Cost/Revenue Dashboard Research

Marcel requested research on dashboard solutions to track:
- Project costs (time + expenses)
- Project revenue
- Time tracking per agent/project
- Profitability per project (which made money vs lost money)
- Live/real-time updates
- Self-hosted on Coolify platform

### Research Delivered
Created comprehensive research report at `research/project-dashboard-research.md` covering:

1. **Kimai** - Recommended first choice (one-click Coolify template, time tracking + invoicing + expense plugin)
2. **Invoice Ninja** - Good for invoicing/revenue tracking (one-click Coolify template)
3. **ERPNext** - Full ERP solution with native profitability tracking (more complex setup)
4. **OpenProject + Metabase** - Flexible combo for PM + custom dashboards
5. **solidtime** - Modern alternative (no Coolify template yet)

### Recommended KPIs Documented
- Financial: Gross profit, margin %, cost per hour, budget variance
- Time: Billable ratio, utilization, time to completion
- Project health: Overrun alerts, ROI

### Next Steps (Marcel to decide)
- Deploy Kimai on Coolify as quick win
- Configure first projects and billable rates
- Add Metabase later for unified dashboard
- Or go directly to ERPNext for full integration
