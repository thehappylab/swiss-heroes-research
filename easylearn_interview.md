| Area          | Issue                         | Severity |
| ------------- | ----------------------------- | -------- |
| UX/UI         | Dated, clunky interface       | High     |
| Mobile        | No usable mobile app          | High     |
| Content       | Generic, not engaging         | Medium   |
| Search        | Hard to find relevant courses | Medium   |
| Progress      | No sense of achievement       | Medium   |
| Notifications | Spammy email reminders        | Low      |

Unmet Needs

Bite-sized learning: "I have 15 minutes between meetings. Let me actually use them.",
Career relevance: "Show me courses that help me get promoted, not just check compliance boxes.",
Social proof: "Tell me what my peers are taking and why.",
Offline access: "I commute 45 minutes. I want to learn on the train without burning data.",

Switching Conditions

Would switch if competitor offered:

• Modern, app-like experience (must-have)
• Mobile-first design (must-have)
• Better content curation/recommendations (must-have)
• Similar or lower price (nice-to-have)
• Certificates recognized by Swiss employers (must-have)

"If something looked like Notion or Figma but taught me compliance stuff, I'd push my HR team to switch."

Price Sensitivity

• Currently: Employer pays (unknown exact cost, estimates CHF 8-15/user/month)
• Personal willingness: CHF 15-20/month for premium, CHF 5-10/month for basic
• Key insight: Willing to pay more if quality is demonstrably better
[10:24]Friday, 27 February 2026 at 10:24
Strategic Signal: OPPORTUNITY

This persona represents a strong wedge. Dissatisfaction is genuine, motivation to switch exists if friction is low, and the current provider has significant UX debt. The switching cost is organizational (HR decision), not personal loyalty.

Interview 2: The Corporate Buyer / HR Decision-Maker

Participant Profile

• Name: Sandra (anonymized)
• Age: 42
• Role: Head of L&D at Swiss manufacturing SME (180 employees)
• Budget: CHF 15,000-25,000/year for learning platforms
• Current: Uses easylearn + in-person workshops
• Decision Criteria: Compliance, reporting, data security, price
[10:24]Friday, 27 February 2026 at 10:24
Key Quotes

"I don't love easylearn, but I trust it won't get me fired."

"Swiss data hosting is non-negotiable. My CIO asks about this every year."

"The compliance reporting is what I actually need. Everything else is bonus."

"Switching costs me 6 months of my life. New vendor evaluation, procurement, implementation, training trainers. The juice has to be worth the squeeze."

Purchase Decision Criteria (Ranked)

| Rank | Criteria                       | Weight       | easylearn Score |
| ---- | ------------------------------ | ------------ | --------------- |
| 1    | Swiss GDPR/compliance          | Critical     | Good            |
[10:24]Friday, 27 February 2026 at 10:24
| 2    | Audit-ready reporting          | Critical     | Good            |
| 3    | Data residency (Swiss hosting) | Critical     | Yes             |
| 4    | Integration with HRIS          | Important    | Okay            |
| 5    | Content library depth          | Important    | Okay            |
| 6    | Price                          | Important    | Okay            |
| 7    | User experience                | Nice-to-have | Poor            |
| 8    | Mobile app                     | Nice-to-have | None            |

Procurement Reality

Typical buying process:

Request for proposal (2-3 vendors),
Reference calls with other Swiss companies,
Legal/security review (2-4 weeks),
Pilot with 10-20 users (1-2 months),
[10:24]Friday, 27 February 2026 at 10:24
Contract negotiation (1 month),
Implementation (1-2 months),
Go-live and training,

Total time: 4-6 months minimum

Switching Barriers

• Contract lock-in: Typical 2-3 year terms with annual renewals
• Migration effort: User data, course progress, certificates
• Training overhead: Managers need to learn new admin tools
• Risk aversion: "What if the new tool fails during audit season?"
• Relationship: "I've worked with my easylearn rep for 5 years"

Ideal Competitive Offering

The buyer would consider switching for:
[10:24]Friday, 27 February 2026 at 10:24
"Same compliance + reporting, better UX, Swiss hosting, and someone who makes migration painless. Price 10-15% lower helps but isn't the driver."

Must-haves to win:

• Swiss data residency (GDPR-compliant)
• Audit/compliance reporting that matches or exceeds current
• References from 3+ similar Swiss companies
• Migration support (not just "here's an API")
• Transparent, predictable pricing

Price Expectations

• Current spend: ~CHF 12/user/month (bulk rate)
• Competitive range: CHF 8-15/user/month
• Important: Price alone won't drive switching; trust and risk mitigation matter more

Strategic Signal: CAUTIOUS ENTRY POINT
[10:24]Friday, 27 February 2026 at 10:24
B2B buyers are risk-averse and sticky. The switching cost is real (time + uncertainty), not just financial. A new entrant needs:

• Strong Swiss compliance credentials
• References and case studies
• Migration as a service (not DIY)
• Sales team that understands enterprise procurement

This is a 12-18 month sales cycle, not a PLG land-and-expand.

Interview 3: The Non-User / Alternative Seeker

Participant Profile

• Name: Laura (anonymized)
• Age: 28
[10:24]Friday, 27 February 2026 at 10:24
• Role: UX Designer at Swiss startup
• Learning habits: YouTube, MasterClass, internal peer-learning, conferences
• Awareness: Knows easylearn exists, never considered using it

Key Quotes

"Formal learning platforms feel like eating vegetables. I learn by doing and watching people who are good."

"If my company made me use easylearn, I'd watch the videos on 2x speed with my phone on the table while actually doing something else."

"The best learning I've done was shadowing our senior designer for a week. No certificate, but I actually got better."

"I don't want a course. I want to solve my problem right now."

Why They Avoid Traditional Platforms
[10:24]Friday, 27 February 2026 at 10:24
| Barrier       | Description                                         |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Format        | Long courses, abstract content, academic tone       |
| Time          | "I don't have 4 hours for a module"                 |
| Relevance     | Generic content, not specific to my role            |
| Motivation    | No intrinsic motivation; feels like homework        |
| Discovery     | Learn about new tools from Twitter, podcasts, peers |
| Certification | Doesn't value formal certificates                   |

Current Learning Stack

| Resource                   | Use Case                          | Time/Week |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------- | --------- |
| YouTube tutorials          | Specific tool/technique questions | 3-4 hrs   |
[10:24]Friday, 27 February 2026 at 10:24
| MasterClass                | Inspiration, general skills       | 1-2 hrs   |
| Internal Slack communities | Peer problem-solving              | Daily     |
| Design Twitter/Mastodon    | Trends, ideas                     | Daily     |
| In-person workshops        | Deep skills, networking           | Quarterly |
| Books/blogs                | Deep thinking                     | 1-2 hrs   |

What Would Make Them Engage

Not interested in:

• Traditional course format
• Compliance/forced training
• Generic business skills
• Gamification "tricks"

• Short, tactical videos ("How to...")
• Community of practice (peer learning)
• Learning embedded in workflow (just-in-time)
• Mentorship matching
• Cohort-based learning (accountability)

Strategic Signal: DIFFERENT MARKET

This persona represents a different product entirely, not a "better easylearn." They reject the fundamental premise of corporate LMS platforms.

If targeting this segment, you'd be building:

• A modern professional learning community (not an LMS)
• Just-in-time microlearning (not course catalogs)
• Peer-to-peer knowledge sharing (not top-down training)

This is higher risk but potentially higher reward if executed well. It also doesn't compete directly with easylearn - it creates a new category.

Swiss Data Hosting: Non-negotiable for B2B buyers,
Compliance/Reporting Parity: Match easylearn's audit capabilities,
Modern UX: 10x better user experience (mobile-first, fast, intuitive),
Migration Service: Remove switching friction, don't just offer tools,
References: Get 3+ Swiss reference customers before scaling sales,

Recommended Entry Strategy

Phase 1 (Months 1-6): Bottom-Up Wedge

• Target dissatisfied end-users at SMEs
• Freemium or low-cost individual tier
• Build advocacy among employees who push HR to switch
• Case study: "How [Company X] switched and achieved [result]"

Phase 2 (Months 6-12): Land-and-Expand

• Convert individual advocates to B2B pilots
• Target companies with contract renewal windows
• Offer migration as a service
• Build reference base

Phase 3 (Months 12-24): Enterprise Sales

• Hire B2B sales with Swiss enterprise experience
• Compliance-first positioning
• Competitive displacement campaigns

Risk Factors

• Switching costs are real: 4-6 month sales cycles, relationship-driven
• Trust gap: New vendor vs. established player with 5-10 year track record
• Compliance complexity: Swiss labor law, data protection requirements
• Feature parity expectation: Buyers expect full LMS capability on day 1

Alternative Path: Adjacent Category

The Non-User interview reveals a separate opportunity: modern professional learning for creative/knowledge workers who reject traditional LMS entirely.

• Position as "MasterClass/YouTube for professional skills"
• Individual-first, company-second (reverse of easylearn)
• Community + microlearning + peer connection
• No compliance/auditing features (intentionally)

This is higher risk but avoids direct competition with easylearn entirely.

| ---------------------------------------- | ----------- | ------------------------- | ---------- |
| Dissatisfied User (Small/High price)     | HIGH        | PLG, self-serve           | CHF 5-8    |
| Dissatisfied User (Large/Low price)      | MEDIUM      | Enterprise sales          | CHF 15-20  |

| Non-User (Startup/Flexible)              | MEDIUM      | Learning stipend hub      | CHF 10-15  |

Refined Recommendations

Start at bottom: 10-50 employee companies, CHF 6-8, self-serve,
Build gradually: Don't chase 500+ until 10+ references at 100-200,
Consider dual track: Corporate LMS vs Professional Learning Hub are different products,
Price anchoring: "CHF 6/user - less than lunch" for small, "TCO savings 30%+" for large
